        <h1>About CamelTutor</h1>
        <p>CamelTutor is an interactive learning platform built for OCaml enthusiasts. Using CamelTutor, you can write, execute, and explore OCaml code directly in your browser as you follow along with the concepts from the <em>Real World OCaml</em> book.</p>
        
        <p>This platform is designed to make learning OCaml easier and more interactive by embedding code editors and interactive elements directly into the text, enabling a hands-on experience.</p>

        <p>CamelTutor is built as a lightweight reverse proxy injecting useful features like code editors on the original Real World Ocaml website, so the content is always up to date.</p>
